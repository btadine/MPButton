Have you ever tried to edit the constraints of the elements inside a UIButton? 
Adding new elements without breaking existing layout?
Just make the touchable area bigger?
If you're smiling, probably you did!

MPButton decorates any view that you provide adding UIControlEvents (ie. touchUpInside) and custom hit box, so you can just focus in the UI.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

MPButton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "MPButton"
```
